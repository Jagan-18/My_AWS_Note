# AWS S3  (Simple Storage Service) :

# What is Amazon S3?
1. Simple Storage Service is a scalable, Highly Available , Cost effective and secure cloud storage service provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS). It allows you to store and retrieve any amount of data from anywhere on the web.
2. It is designed for:
 - **High durability** (11 nines: 99.999999999%)
 - **Scalability** (stores trillions of objects)
 - **Low latency and high throughput**

**(OR)**
- Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) is a scalable object storage service designed to store and retrieve any amount of data from anywhere on the web. It's commonly used to store files, backups, images, videos, and more.
- It looks similar to your Google drive/ one drive and also allow unlimited amount of data (Highly scalable – Up to 5TD per file).

# What are S3 buckets? / What can you store in these S3?
1. S3 buckets are containers for storing objects (files, images, videos, and more.) in Amazon S3. Each bucket has a unique name globally across all of AWS. 
2. You can think of an S3 bucket as a top-level folder that holds your data

**OR**
>  An **S3 Bucket** is a **container for storing objects (files/data)**.
> * All objects are stored **inside buckets**.
> * Each bucket must have a **globally unique name**.
> * Buckets live **within regions** (e.g., `us-east-1`), which determines **latency and data residency**.

### 📦 What Is a Bucket?


---

### 🧾 Object Basics

* **Object** = Data + Metadata + Key (name)
* Each object is identified by a **key** (filename/path inside the bucket).
* Objects can be up to **5 TB** in size.

## 🪣 **Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service) – Full Explanation**

---

### 📘 **What is Amazon S3?**
Amazon S3 is a **fully managed object storage service** that allows you to store and retrieve **any amount of data**, at **any time**, from **anywhere** on the web.  


---

### 📦 **What is an S3 Bucket?**
- A **bucket** is a **logical container** in Amazon S3 used to store objects.
- **Objects** are the actual data (files), consisting of:
  - **Key** (name)
  - **Data** (content)
  - **Metadata** (info like size, type, etc.)
- Bucket names must be **globally unique**.
- Buckets are created in **AWS regions**, impacting latency and pricing.
