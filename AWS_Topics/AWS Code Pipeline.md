## ✅ **What is AWS CodePipeline?**
**AWS CodePipeline** is a fully managed **continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD)** service that automates your software release process. It helps you build, test, and deploy your code every time there is a change.

> Think of it as an **automated assembly line** for your application from code commit to deployment.

## 🛠️ **Key Features**
| Feature                                   | Description                                                                     |
| ----------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Fully Managed**                         | No need to maintain your own Jenkins server or runners.                         |
| **Event-Driven**                          | Triggers automatically on source changes (e.g., GitHub commit, CodeCommit).     |
| **Integrates with AWS & 3rd Party Tools** | Works with CodeBuild, CodeDeploy, Lambda, GitHub, Jenkins, CloudFormation, etc. |
| **Visual Workflow Editor**                | Easily define and visualize each stage of your pipeline.                        |
| **Parallel Execution**                    | Supports parallel actions in a single stage.                                    |
| **Secure with IAM**                       | Granular access control for each stage using IAM roles.                         |

## 🚀 **Typical CodePipeline Stages**
```
[Source] → [Build] → [Test] → [Deploy] → [Approval]
```

### 1. **Source**
* Triggers pipeline on code changes.
* Sources: GitHub, S3, CodeCommit, Bitbucket.

### 2. **Build**
* Uses AWS CodeBuild or other tools to compile code, run tests, create artifacts.

### 3. **Test (Optional)**
* Automated tests (e.g., unit, integration) can be run here.

### 4. **Deploy**
* Automatically deploys to environments (e.g., EC2, ECS, Lambda, S3) using:

  * CodeDeploy
  * Elastic Beanstalk
  * CloudFormation

### 5. **Manual Approval (Optional)**
* Pause for a **human reviewer** to approve before continuing to production.

## 📌 **Simple Example Use Case**
You have a React web app in GitHub:

1. **Source**: GitHub repo push triggers the pipeline.
2. **Build**: CodeBuild compiles React and produces static files.
3. **Deploy**: Upload to S3 and invalidate CloudFront cache.
4. **Notify**: Send Slack or email notification on success/failure.

---

## 🧱 **How to Create a CodePipeline (AWS Console)**
### Step-by-step:

1. Go to **CodePipeline** → Click **Create pipeline**.
2. Enter pipeline name and choose service role (create or existing).
3. **Add Source** (e.g., GitHub, CodeCommit).
4. **Add Build** (e.g., CodeBuild project).
5. **Add Deploy** (e.g., CodeDeploy, ECS, Lambda).
6. Optional: Add **Manual approval** before deploy.
7. Click **Create pipeline** — it starts automatically.

## 📦 CodePipeline Integrations:
| Integration Type | Examples                                |
| ---------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| **Source**       | CodeCommit, GitHub, Bitbucket           |
| **Build/Test**   | CodeBuild, Jenkins                      |
| **Deploy**       | CodeDeploy, ECS, CloudFormation, Lambda |
| **Notification** | SNS, Slack (via Lambda), Email          |
| **Monitoring**   | CloudWatch Events, Logs, Metrics        |

## ⚖️ Pros & Cons:
#### ✅ Pros:
* Fully managed and serverless.
* Seamless integration with AWS ecosystem.
* Easy to trigger and automate end-to-end deployments.
* Visual editor and YAML definition support (via CloudFormation).

#### ❌ Cons:
* Less flexible than Jenkins/GitHub Actions.
* Debugging can be harder without centralized logs.
* Limited conditional logic or fan-in/out support.

## 📝 YAML Example (via CloudFormation):
```yaml
Resources:
  MyPipeline:
    Type: AWS::CodePipeline::Pipeline
    Properties:
      RoleArn: arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/MyPipelineRole
      Stages:
        - Name: Source
          Actions:
            - Name: SourceAction
              ActionTypeId:
                Category: Source
                Owner: AWS
                Provider: CodeCommit
                Version: 1
              OutputArtifacts:
                - Name: SourceOutput
              Configuration:
                RepositoryName: MyRepo
                BranchName: main
        - Name: Build
          Actions:
            - Name: BuildAction
              ActionTypeId:
                Category: Build
                Owner: AWS
                Provider: CodeBuild
                Version: 1
              InputArtifacts:
                - Name: SourceOutput
              OutputArtifacts:
                - Name: BuildOutput
              Configuration:
                ProjectName: MyCodeBuildProject
```

## ✅ Summary

* **AWS CodePipeline** is a powerful tool for **automating CI/CD** pipelines.
* Works best if your stack is AWS-native (CodeCommit, CodeBuild, CodeDeploy, Lambda).
* For **modern DevOps**, pair it with:
  `GitHub/GitLab + CodeBuild + CloudFormation + SNS/Slack`.

# **Project:**  
> Design and implement a CI/CD pipeline using **AWS CodePipeline** to automate the deployment of an application. The pipeline should include:
> - **Source code integration** (e.g., CodeCommit or GitHub)  
> - **Build process** using AWS CodeBuild  
> - **Automated deployment** to the target environment using AWS CodeDeploy or another suitable service
