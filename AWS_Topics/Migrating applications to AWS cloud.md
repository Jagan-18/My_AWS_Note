# Migrating application:
Migrating applications means moving an existing app from one environment to another ‚Äî usually from **on-premises to the cloud (AWS, Azure, GCP)** or between cloud providers. In AWS, migration is a **step-by-step process** to ensure minimum downtime, performance, and cost optimization.

## üöÄ Types of Application Migrations
1. **Rehost ("Lift and Shift")**

   * Move apps as-is, no major changes.
   * Example: Moving a VM from on-prem to AWS EC2.

2. **Replatform ("Lift, Tinker, and Shift")**

   * Minor optimizations during migration.
   * Example: Migrating app to AWS RDS instead of self-managed DB.

3. **Repurchase**

   * Move to a new product/SaaS.
   * Example: Migrating CRM to Salesforce.

4. **Refactor/Re-architect**

   * Rebuild app to use cloud-native features.
   * Example: Moving monolith ‚Üí microservices on AWS Lambda/EKS.

5. **Retain**

   * Keep certain apps where they are (not migrated).

6. **Retire**

   * Decommission apps not needed anymore.

## üõ†Ô∏è Steps in AWS Application Migration
1. **Assessment**

   * Use **AWS Migration Hub / Application Discovery Service** to analyze apps.
   * Check dependencies, performance, and cost.

2. **Planning**

   * Decide migration strategy (rehost, refactor, etc.).
   * Define VPC, security, IAM, and compliance needs.

3. **Migration Execution**
   * **Servers:** AWS Application Migration Service (MGN) ‚Üí EC2.
   * **Databases:** AWS Database Migration Service (DMS).
   * **Storage:** AWS S3 Transfer Acceleration, Snowball.
   * **Apps:** Containerize and move to ECS/EKS.

4. **Validation & Testing**

   * Functional and performance testing.
   * Switch DNS via **Route 53** after validation.

5. **Optimization**

   * Right-size EC2, use Auto Scaling, Savings Plans.
   * Apply **CloudWatch** and **AWS Config** for monitoring.

## üìå Real-World Example

* A retail company moves its **on-prem app** to AWS:

  * Web app ‚Üí EC2 Auto Scaling + ALB
  * Database ‚Üí RDS (Aurora)
  * Media files ‚Üí S3 + CloudFront
  * Monitoring ‚Üí CloudWatch
  * CI/CD ‚Üí CodePipeline

## **‚ÄúHow did you migrate your application onto the cloud?‚Äù** or about **Cloud Migration Strategies**, they are usually referring to the **‚Äú6 Rs of Cloud Migration‚Äù** (defined by AWS). 

### **Cloud Migration Strategies (6 Rs):**

1. **Rehost ("Lift-and-Shift")**

   * Move applications to the cloud *as-is* with minimal changes.
   * Fastest way, but doesn‚Äôt leverage cloud-native features.
   * Example: Moving a VM from on-premises to an EC2 instance.

2. **Replatform ("Lift-Tinker-and-Shift")**

   * Make small optimizations before moving to the cloud.
   * Example: Migrating an on-prem database to Amazon RDS instead of running it on EC2.

3. **Repurchase ("Drop-and-Shop")**

   * Move to a new product/SaaS solution.
   * Example: Moving from on-premise CRM to Salesforce, or from in-house email servers to Office 365.

4. **Refactor / Re-architect**

   * Re-design the application to be cloud-native.
   * Example: Breaking a monolithic app into microservices and deploying on Kubernetes/EKS.

5. **Retire**

   * Decommission applications that are no longer useful.
   * Saves cost and reduces complexity.

6. **Retain**

   * Keep some workloads on-premise (hybrid approach).
   * Example: Apps with strict compliance or latency requirements.

## **How DevOps Engineers Migrate Applications in Real Projects**
When I (as a DevOps engineer) help migrate an application, I usually follow these steps:

1. **Assessment & Planning**

   * Understand the current application architecture.
   * Decide which migration strategy (from 6 Rs) suits best.
   * Perform cost and dependency analysis.

2. **Set Up Cloud Infrastructure**

   * Create a **VPC, subnets, security groups, IAM roles**.
   * Set up **networking, monitoring, and backups**.

3. **Migrate Data**

   * Use tools like **AWS DMS** (Database Migration Service) or **S3 + Snowball** for large datasets.

4. **Application Migration**

   * Lift-and-shift to EC2,
   * Or containerize and deploy to **ECS/EKS**,
   * Or move to serverless (**Lambda + API Gateway**).

5. **Testing**

   * Validate performance, security, and compliance.
   * Run automated CI/CD pipelines for deployment.

6. **Cutover & Monitoring**

   * Switch traffic using **Route53 + Load Balancers**.
   * Monitor with **CloudWatch, X-Ray, and logging tools**.

‚úÖ Example:
In one project, we migrated a **Java monolithic application**:

* Phase 1: Rehost ‚Üí moved app to EC2.
* Phase 2: Replatform ‚Üí database migrated to RDS.
* Phase 3: Refactor ‚Üí broke down into microservices, deployed on **EKS** with CI/CD pipelines.
