## ✅ What is AWS CloudWatch?
AWS CloudWatch is a powerful monitoring and observability service provided by Amazon Web Services. It enables you to gain insights into the performance, health, and operational aspects of your AWS resources and applications. CloudWatch collects and tracks metrics, collects and monitors log files, and sets alarms to alert you on certain conditions.

## 🧠 How CloudWatch Works
```
Your AWS services + custom applications
          │
      send logs/metrics
          ↓
   🌐 CloudWatch collects it
          ↓
     Logs → Log Groups & Streams
     Metrics → Namespaces & Dimensions
          ↓
     You set Alarms, Dashboards, or Events
```
---
### ✅ Common Use Cases:
1. **Monitor EC2 instance health** (CPU, memory, disk, etc.)
2. **Alert if Lambda errors exceed a threshold**
3. **Auto-scale ECS/EC2 based on CPU load**
4. **Track S3 bucket operations and failures**
5. **Create operational dashboards for real-time visibility**
6. **Audit login events and AWS API usage**
7. **Store application logs from Java, Python, Node.js**

---

## 🔔 CloudWatch Alarms
Alarms allow you to **automate responses** and **notify teams** when a metric crosses a threshold.

**Example:**
“If CPU utilization > 80% for 5 minutes, send SNS alert or scale out an Auto Scaling Group.”

---
## 🔧 CloudWatch Logs

Organized into:

* **Log Group** → e.g., `/aws/lambda/my-function`
* **Log Stream** → Per-instance or per-execution logs

You can **search, filter, and export logs**, and even use **CloudWatch Logs Insights** to run queries on log data.
