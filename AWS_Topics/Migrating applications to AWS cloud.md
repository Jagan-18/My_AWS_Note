Migrating applications means moving an existing app from one environment to another ‚Äî usually from **on-premises to the cloud (AWS, Azure, GCP)** or between cloud providers. In AWS, migration is a **step-by-step process** to ensure minimum downtime, performance, and cost optimization.

## üöÄ Types of Application Migrations

1. **Rehost ("Lift and Shift")**

   * Move apps as-is, no major changes.
   * Example: Moving a VM from on-prem to AWS EC2.

2. **Replatform ("Lift, Tinker, and Shift")**

   * Minor optimizations during migration.
   * Example: Migrating app to AWS RDS instead of self-managed DB.

3. **Repurchase**

   * Move to a new product/SaaS.
   * Example: Migrating CRM to Salesforce.

4. **Refactor/Re-architect**

   * Rebuild app to use cloud-native features.
   * Example: Moving monolith ‚Üí microservices on AWS Lambda/EKS.

5. **Retain**

   * Keep certain apps where they are (not migrated).

6. **Retire**

   * Decommission apps not needed anymore.

## üõ†Ô∏è Steps in AWS Application Migration

1. **Assessment**

   * Use **AWS Migration Hub / Application Discovery Service** to analyze apps.
   * Check dependencies, performance, and cost.

2. **Planning**

   * Decide migration strategy (rehost, refactor, etc.).
   * Define VPC, security, IAM, and compliance needs.

3. **Migration Execution**

   * **Servers:** AWS Application Migration Service (MGN) ‚Üí EC2.
   * **Databases:** AWS Database Migration Service (DMS).
   * **Storage:** AWS S3 Transfer Acceleration, Snowball.
   * **Apps:** Containerize and move to ECS/EKS.

4. **Validation & Testing**

   * Functional and performance testing.
   * Switch DNS via **Route 53** after validation.

5. **Optimization**

   * Right-size EC2, use Auto Scaling, Savings Plans.
   * Apply **CloudWatch** and **AWS Config** for monitoring.

## üìå Real-World Example

* A retail company moves its **on-prem app** to AWS:

  * Web app ‚Üí EC2 Auto Scaling + ALB
  * Database ‚Üí RDS (Aurora)
  * Media files ‚Üí S3 + CloudFront
  * Monitoring ‚Üí CloudWatch
  * CI/CD ‚Üí CodePipeline
