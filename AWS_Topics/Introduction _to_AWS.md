# What is Cloud Service?
A cloud service is any service made available to users on-demand via the internet from a cloud computing provider‚Äôs servers. It allows users to access computing resources like storage, software, and servers without owning or managing physical infrastructure

# What is AWS Cloud?
 AWS (Amazon Web Services) is a leading cloud computing platform developed by Amazon. It provides a wide range of on-demand cloud services such as computing power, storage, and databases.
> AWS launched its first product, Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service), in 2006.

# What is Cloud Computing?
1. Cloud computing is a term referred to storing and accessing data over the internet.
2. It doesn‚Äôt store any data on the hard disk of your personal computer. In cloud computing, you can access data from a remote server.
3. Cloud computing is a pay-as-you-go model for delivering IT resources.
4. It is the delivery of computing services-servers, storage, databases, networking, software, analytics and  more-over the internet.

**There are basically 3 categories in cloud computing:**
1. **SaaS (Software as a Service):** It allows companies to use software without having to purchase them, which reduces the expenditure of the company drastically, since they are already installed on the cloud server they can be quickly deployed and therefore saves time.
2. **PaaS (Platform as a Service):** It allows developers to build applications, collaborate on projects without having to purchase or maintain infrastructure.
3. **IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service):** It allows companies to rent servers, storage space, etc. from a cloud provider.

# ‚úÖ What is Public Cloud?
1. A **public cloud** is open to everyone and allows users to **store and access information over the internet** using a **pay-per-usage** model.
2. It is a **cloud service offered to multiple customers** by a third-party cloud provider such as **AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud**.
3. Resources like servers, storage, and networking are **shared** among multiple users (multi-tenant model).

---
# ‚úÖ What is Private Cloud?
1. A **private cloud** (also known as **internal cloud** or **corporate cloud**) is used by a **single organization**, either managed internally or hosted by a third-party provider.
2. In this model, the infrastructure and services are **not shared with other organizations** ‚Äî giving the company full control, privacy, and security.
3. It is ideal for organizations with **strict data governance or compliance requirements**.

---
# ‚úÖ Why is Public Cloud So Popular?
1. **Scalability:**
   * Easily and quickly scale compute, storage, and network resources as needed.
   * Servers and services can be deployed in **minutes or hours**, instead of days or weeks.
2. **Cost-Effective:**
   * Pay only for what you use (pay-as-you-go).
   * No upfront investment in hardware or infrastructure.
3. **Time-Saving:**
   * Quick setup and fast deployment help organizations **go to market faster**.
4. **Global Access & Reliability:**
   * Accessible from anywhere via the internet.
   * Cloud providers offer **high uptime, redundancy, and global presence**.

# ‚úÖ **Public Cloud vs Private Cloud: Key Differences:**
--------------------------------------------------------
* **Public Cloud** is **cost-effective**, **scalable**, and **easy to access**, ideal for general-purpose workloads.
* **Private Cloud** is best for organizations needing **data privacy**, **custom security**, and **regulatory compliance**.
