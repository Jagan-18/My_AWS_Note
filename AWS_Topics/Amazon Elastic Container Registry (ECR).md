# üê≥ Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR) 

## ‚úÖ **What is AWS ECR?**
1.	AWS Elastic Container Registry (ECR) is a fully  managed **Docker container image registry** provided by AWS.
2.	It enables you to store, manage, and deploy container images (Docker images) securely, making it an essential component of your containerized application development workflow.
3.	ECR integrates seamlessly with other AWS services like Amazon Elastic Container Service (ECS) and Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS).
4.  It allows you to **store, manage, and deploy** container images securely and at scale.

## üß† **Key Concepts**
| Term                 | Description                                                     |
| -------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Repositories**     | Logical groups where container images are stored                |
| **Images**           | Packaged application code, config, libraries (in Docker format) |
| **Image Tag**        | Version label (e.g., `latest`, `v1.0`) for each container image |
| **Lifecycle Policy** | Rule to automatically delete old/unused images                  |
| **IAM Permissions**  | Control access to push/pull images securely                     |

# Key Benefits of ECR:
1.	**Security:** ECR offers encryption at rest, and images are stored in private repositories by default, ensuring the security of your container images.
2.	**Integration:** ECR integrates smoothly with AWS services like ECS and EKS, simplifying the deployment process.
3.	**Scalability:** As a managed service, ECR automatically scales to meet the demands of your container image storage.
4.	**Availability:** ECR guarantees high availability, reducing the risk of image unavailability during critical times.
5.	**Lifecycle Policies:** You can define lifecycle policies to automate the cleanup of unused or old container images, helping you save on storage costs.

## ‚öôÔ∏è **ECR Workflow: From Local to Cloud**
1. **Build** a Docker image locally
2. **Tag** the image with your ECR repo URL
3. **Authenticate** Docker to AWS ECR
4. **Push** the image to your ECR repository
5. **Pull** the image from ECR when deploying via ECS, EKS, EC2, or Fargate

## üöÄ **Step-by-Step: Create & Push Docker Image to ECR**
### üîπ Step 1: Create a Repository in ECR

```bash
aws ecr create-repository --repository-name my-app --region us-east-1
```

### üîπ Step 2: Authenticate Docker with ECR
```bash
aws ecr get-login-password --region us-east-1 | docker login --username AWS --password-stdin <your_account_id>.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com
```

### üîπ Step 3: Build and Tag Docker Image
```bash
docker build -t my-app .
docker tag my-app:latest <your_account_id>.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/my-app:latest
```

### üîπ Step 4: Push the Image to ECR
```bash
docker push <your_account_id>.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/my-app:latest
```

### üîπ Step 5: Use Image in ECS or EKS
In your ECS Task Definition or Kubernetes Deployment YAML, use the image URL:

```
<your_account_id>.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/my-app:latest
```

## üõ°Ô∏è **Security & Best Practices**
* üîê Enable **encryption at rest** and in transit (default)
* üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Use **IAM policies** to restrict push/pull access
* ‚ôªÔ∏è Set **lifecycle rules** to clean up unused images
* üß™ Scan images with **ECR image scanning** (vulnerability checks)

## üß∞ **Useful CLI Commands**
| Task                | Command                                                                           |
| ------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| List repositories   | `aws ecr describe-repositories`                                                   |
| List images in repo | `aws ecr list-images --repository-name my-app`                                    |
| Delete image        | `aws ecr batch-delete-image --repository-name my-app --image-ids imageTag=latest` |
| Set lifecycle rule  | Use `put-lifecycle-policy` or Console UI                                          |

## üß™ Example Use Case
* You build a Docker image with your app.
* Push it to ECR.
* Deploy it with ECS Fargate (serverless containers).
* Monitor image scans and automate cleanup with lifecycle policies.

---
## üìå Bonus: Enable Image Scanning
```bash
aws ecr put-image-scanning-configuration \
    --repository-name my-app \
    --image-scanning-configuration scanOnPush=true
```

# What is different Between ECR and Docker Hub or other container registers?
**1. Integration:**
   * **ECR:** Tightly integrated with AWS services, such as Amazon ECS, Amazon EKS, and AWS Lambda.
   * **Docker Hub:** Standalone registry that can be used with various container orchestration tools and services.

**2. Security and Compliance:**
   * **ECR:** Provides encryption at rest and in transit, image scanning, and vulnerability detection. Compliant with HIPAA, PCI-DSS, GDPR, and more.
   * **Docker Hub:** Offers some security features, but not as comprehensive as ECR.
**3. Pricing:**
   * **ECR:** Pricing based on the number of images stored and data transferred.
   * **Docker Hub:** Free

### üîç **When to Use ECR**
‚úÖ You're deploying containers using **AWS ECS, EKS, or Lambda**

‚úÖ You need **fine-grained access control via IAM**

‚úÖ You want to manage lifecycle, scanning, and cost within **AWS ecosystem**

‚úÖ You require **region-specific performance** and **private networking (VPC endpoints)**

---
### üîç **When to Use Docker Hub or Others**
‚úÖ You're running containers **locally or on multiple cloud platforms**

‚úÖ You need **public image distribution** (e.g., for open-source)

‚úÖ You already use **GitHub or GitLab** and prefer integrated registries (GHCR or GitLab Registry)

# What container Registry are using?
1. I‚Äôm familiar with **Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR)**, which is a fully managed container registry service provided by AWS.

2. In my previous projects, I‚Äôve used ECR to **store and manage container images**, especially in deployments using **Amazon ECS and EKS**.

3. ECR offers a **secure, scalable, and tightly integrated** solution within the AWS ecosystem. I‚Äôve worked with ECR to **push and pull container images**, and I‚Äôve leveraged features like **image scanning and vulnerability detection** to ensure the security of my containerized applications.

# Terraform or CloudFormation to create an ECR + push automation?

### ‚úÖ **1. Using Terraform**
**Why use Terraform?**
* Platform-agnostic (works across AWS, GCP, Azure, etc.)
* Declarative, easy-to-read `.tf` files
* Rich ecosystem of providers/modules
* Often preferred for DevOps automation and multi-cloud workflows

**Sample Terraform Workflow for ECR:**
```hcl
# Create ECR Repository
resource "aws_ecr_repository" "my_app_repo" {
  name = "my-app-repo"
}

# Login & Push Image Script (bash/CI/CD pipeline)
aws ecr get-login-password --region us-east-1 | docker login --username AWS --password-stdin <account-id>.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com
docker build -t my-app .
docker tag my-app:latest <account-id>.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/my-app-repo
docker push <account-id>.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/my-app-repo
```

---
## ‚úÖ **2. Using AWS CloudFormation**
**Why use CloudFormation?**

* Native to AWS
* Integrated tightly with IAM, CloudTrail, etc.
* Good for AWS-only infrastructure-as-code use cases

**Sample CloudFormation YAML for ECR:**
```yaml
Resources:
  MyECRRepo:
    Type: AWS::ECR::Repository
    Properties:
      RepositoryName: my-app-repo
```

‚û°Ô∏è **Push to ECR** would still need to be done via external script (e.g., in CodeBuild, shell, or pipeline step).
---
### üîç **So which to choose?**
| Criteria                    | Choose Terraform               | Choose CloudFormation       |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------ | --------------------------- |
| Multi-cloud or modular IAC  | ‚úÖ Yes                          | ‚ùå AWS only               |
| Reusability/Modularity      | ‚úÖ High (modules, variables)    | üö´ Limited                |
| Simplicity for AWS-only use | ‚úÖ Yes, but more verbose        | ‚úÖ Yes (simple YAML/JSON) | 
| Learning curve              | Moderate (but DevOps standard) | Lower (for AWS users)       |
---
### üöÄ Recommendation:
> Use **Terraform** if:
>
> * You want **full automation**, including scripting build and push
> * You're working in a **DevOps environment** with IaC best practices
> * You may manage infrastructure beyond AWS

> Use **CloudFormation** if:
>
> * You're in an **AWS-only shop**
> * Your team is already using it
> * You‚Äôre using **CodePipeline/CodeBuild** and need tight AWS integration
