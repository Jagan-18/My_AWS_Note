AWS Cloud roadmaps should be simple.

We make it complicated with roles.

First cover the basics before you go advanced.

Phase 1: Basic & General
Phase 2: Basic & Specialized

Evolve through these phases by learning and mastering:

𝗣𝗵𝗮𝘀𝗲 𝟭: 𝗕𝗮𝘀𝗶𝗰 & 𝗚𝗲𝗻𝗲𝗿𝗮𝗹
- ELB (Distribute incoming application traffic)
- NACLs (Secure subnets with custom IP rules)
- AWS Budgets (Manage cloud costs and usage)
- Auto Scaling (Scale EC2 capacity automatically)
- S3 Buckets and Objects (Store and retrieve data)
- Internet Gateways (Connect VPCs to the internet)
- EC2 Instances (Run applications on virtual servers)
- Route Tables (Direct network traffic from your VPC)
- Route 53 (Route end users to Internet applications)
- Security Groups (Filter traffic to and from instances)
- VPC (Provision a private, isolated section of the cloud)
- CloudWatch (Monitor resources and applications in real-time)
- Amazon RDS (Set up, operate, and scale a relational database)
- AWS Global Infrastructure (Leverage global reach and availability)
- High Availability Architectures (Design fault-tolerant applications)
- IAM Policies (Securely control access to AWS services and resources)
- IAM Users and Groups (Manage user access and security credentials)
- Disaster Recovery Basics (Implement backup and recovery strategies)

𝗣𝗵𝗮𝘀𝗲 𝟮: 𝗕𝗮𝘀𝗶𝗰 & 𝗦𝗽𝗲𝗰𝗶𝗮𝗹𝗶𝘇𝗲𝗱
- Shield (Protect against DDoS attacks)
- SQS (Decouple application components)
- ELB (Optimize application load balancing)
- ECS (Run containerized applications on AWS)
- KMS (Create and manage cryptographic keys)
- Route 53 (Manage DNS and health-checking for apps)
- WAF (Protect web applications from common web exploits)
- Lambda (Run code without provisioning or managing servers)
- Elastic Beanstalk (Deploy and manage applications in the cloud)
- Snow Family (Migrate data into and out of AWS with physical devices)
- CloudFront (Deliver content with low latency and high transfer speeds)
- API Gateway (Create, publish, maintain, monitor, and secure APIs at any scale)
- Step Functions (Coordinate multiple AWS services into serverless workflows)
- EKS (Deploy, manage, and scale containerized applications using Kubernetes)
- SNS (Decouple and scale microservices, distributed systems, and serverless applications)
- RDS (Enhance database performance with Read Replicas and Multi-AZ deployments)
- S3 (Implement lifecycle rules and cross-region replication for data management)
- Secrets Manager (Protect secrets needed to access your applications, services, and IT resources)
